# Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network Weight Optimization
This repository contains a program that uses a genetic algorithm to improve the weights of a neural network model. The goal of the program is to train the neural network to correctly classify binary strings into either 0 or 1.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

* buildent0_1 + buildnet0_2: These two zip directories contain the files required to run the buildnet0.exe program. To execute the buildnet0.exe, you need to extract both zip files and combine them into a single directory. The purpose of buildnet0.exe is to find the optimal weights for predicting the dataset "nn0".

* buildent1_1 + buildnet1_2: Similar to the previous set of directories, these contain the files necessary to run the buildnet1.exe program. Once again, you should extract both zip files and merge them into one directory. The buildnet1.exe program aims to find the correct weights for predicting the dataset "nn1".

* runnet0.zip: This zip directory contains the runnet0.exe program which exeute the feedforward of the neural network which its weights were discovered during the execution of buildnet0.exe. the feedforword preformed over a new dataset called "testnet0.txt". The program utilizes the weights found in the wnet0.json file, which is the output of buildnet0.exe.

* runnet1.zip: same as above.

## How to Run

1. **Extract the Files:**: 
   - Extract both buildnet0_1.zip and buildnet0_2.zip into the same directory.
   - Extract both buildnet1_1.zip and buildnet1_2.zip into another directory.
2. **Run 'buildnet0.exe'**: 
    - Navigate to the directory containing the extracted files.
    - Execute buildnet0.exe to optimize the weights for the dataset "nn0".
    - The program will output a wnet0.json file containing the optimized weights.
3. **Run 'runnet0.exe'**: 
    - Place the testnet0.txt file in the same directory as 'runnet0.exe'.
    - Execute runnet0.exe to perform feedforward on the new dataset using the weights from wnet0.json.
    - The results will be saved to an output file.
4. **Repeat the Process for 'buildnet1.exe' and 'runnet1.exe' for the "nn1" dataset**

## Program Explanation
The programs in this repository use a genetic algorithm to optimize the weights of a neural network. This method involves creating an initial population of potential solutions (sets of weights), evaluating their performance, and iteratively improving them through selection, crossover, and mutation.

Key details about the genetic algorithm used:

- **Population Size**: 100 individuals.
- **Number of Generations**: Typically runs for 150 generations, with significant improvements
observed around the 80th generation.
- **Mutation Rate**: Set at 15%, with specific adjustments to prevent premature convergence.
- **Crossover**: Uniform crossover is used to combine the genetic material of parent individuals.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: The fitness of each individual is determined by the accuracy of the neural network's predictions.

## Output Files

1. **wnet0.json and wnet1.json**:

- These files are generated by the buildnet0.exe and buildnet1.exe programs, respectively.
- They contain the optimized weights for the neural network after running the genetic algorithm on the datasets "nn0" and "nn1".
- The structure of these files is typically in JSON format, where the weights are organized according to the layers and neurons of the neural network. This allows the runnet0.exe and runnet1.exe programs to load the weights and perform predictions.

2. **output0.txt and output1.txt**:

- These files are generated by the runnet0.exe and runnet1.exe programs.
- They contain the classification results after running the feedforward operation on new datasets (testnet0.txt and testnet1.txt).
- Each line in these files represents the predicted output of the neural network for each binary string in the test dataset.
- These outputs are either 0 or 1, representing the classification decision made by the neural network based on the optimized weights.

## Explanation of the Results:

- **Prediction Accuracy**: The predictions in output0.txt and output1.txt can be compared against the true labels of the test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the neural network. The closer the predictions are to the true labels, the more successful the weight optimization has been.

- **Optimization Quality**: The quality of the weight optimization process can be inferred from the wnet0.json and wnet1.json files. If the genetic algorithm has worked well, the neural network should have learned effective weights that generalize well to new data, resulting in high accuracy on the test datasets.

- **Interpretation**:
- If the network is correctly classifying the majority of the test samples, it indicates that the genetic algorithm successfully optimized the weights.
- If there are significant classification errors, it could suggest issues with the optimization process, such as insufficient generations, poor initial population, or inadequate mutation rates.
